# PythonGameBuilding-Pong
The Paddle Pong Game is a simple and classic arcade-style game implemented using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The game involves two paddles on opposite sides 
of the screen and a ball that moves between them. The objective of the game is to bounce the ball off the paddles, keeping it in play, and prevent it from going past 
your paddle. Players score points whenever the ball successfully passes the opponent's paddle.
